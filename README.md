# Rustc Profiles
I am building developer tooling for Rust. My first tool is an optimized compiler, designed to make incremental builds much faster i.e. less lag in your IDE's IntelliSense and a shorter edit-compile-run cycle.

I am structuring this repo on a project basis for now to profile my improvements.
